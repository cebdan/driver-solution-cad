# Driver-Solution CAD

A parametric CAD system built with C++ using the driver-solution architecture pattern.

## Architecture

This project implements a CAD kernel using a dependency-driven solution system, similar to FreeCAD's approach but with a modern C++ implementation.

## Technology Stack

- **C++17+** - Core language
- **OpenCascade** - 3D geometry kernel
- **CMake** - Build system
- **GLFW** - Window management
- **ImGui** - Immediate mode GUI
- **Catch2** - Unit testing framework
